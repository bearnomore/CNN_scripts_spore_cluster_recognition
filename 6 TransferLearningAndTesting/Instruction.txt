The mat_code 'TransferLearningAndTesting' is used for transfer learning and validation using vgg16 that goes through the steps from 3 to 5. 
I saved some trained networks here:
CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_bigger_s3_10epoch_GoogleleNetTransfer
CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_bigger_s3_10epoch_Vgg16NetTransfer
The performance of the latter is saved as 'performance of comb_bigger_s3_10epoch_Vgg16NetTransfer' here as well.
