The mat_code 'CNN_training4ClusteredSps.m' sets up neural network structure and training paprameters 
I have tried different structures, the one shown here is the one I used 1x1 conv filter before fully connection and generates 'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_bigger_s3_long_convImpOfFilter'.

There are several other trained netorks saved here:
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_bigger_v1'
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_bigger_v2'
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_v1'
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb_v2'
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_comb1'
      	'CNN_spores_by3Lables_thickEdge_comb1'
	
## Feel free to play with it###
